## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Individual Activity: Part 1
* Alter the HTML template for the app.component (app.component.ts).
* Notice that there is an array of albums, you'll need to use *ngFor to iterate through each album.
* Make it look as close to the .png file within the repository.
* For the tracklist, take note of the fact that there's an array of song strings (so the tracks). You'll need to use the *ngFor directive to iterate through the tracks.
* You should include the BUY button at the bottom left side of the album view.
    * the BUY button should be disabled if the user owns the album (use the "[disable]" directive on the button to do this)
